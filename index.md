# My Background
I'm originally from the East Coast and spent my childhood growing up in Northern Virginia.
I earned my B.S. in Materials Science & Engineering with an additional major in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University.
I was strongly influenced by my experiences outside of the classroom as an undergraduate student.
I worked as an undergraduate researcher under the supervision of [Jay Whitacre](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/whitacre/index.html), served as a resident assistant, and held leadership roles in Greek Life.

After graduating from college, I stayed in Pittsburgh and worked for two years before attending graduate school.
My first full time job was in research & development for water based batteries at Aquion Energy.
While I retained my position at Aquion Energy, shortly after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, I began working in Student Affairs at Carnegie Mellon overseeing a student housing community in the Office of Residential Education.

In 2018, I moved to California to pursue my Ph.D. in Materials Science & Engineering at UC Berkeley.
My research focused on computational materials discovery for magnesium cathodes in the [Persson Group](https://perssongroup.lbl.gov/).
Over the course of graduate school, my professional interests shifted from developing next-generation energy storage materials to mentoring and teaching.
I'm particularly interested in cultivating essential teamwork, leadership, and communication skills which are often not emphasized in STEM education.
