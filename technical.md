# My Technical Experiences

## Education
**Summer 2023:** Ph.D. in Materials Science & Engineering from University of California, Berkeley

**Fall 2022:** Masters in Materials Science & Engineering from University of California, Berkeley

**Spring 2016:** B.S. in Materials Science & Engineering with an additional major in Biomedical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon Univerisity

## Industry & Research

My undergraduate research experiences focused on the synthesis, optimization, and characterization of Li and Na intercalation materials for aqueous batteries. 
I also had a summer research experience at Imperial College in London where I worked on casting and characterizing block copolymer thin films.

In my time working at Aquion Energy, my projects aimed to extend the cycle life performance of the aqueous hybrid ion batteries manufactured by the company.
In addition to the active materials, I studied various components of the battery cell such as electrode additives and current collectors.

In graduate school, I shifted from experimental work to computational materials science.
In order to perform high-throughput screenings based on first principle calculations for my research focused on the discovery high-performance magnesium cathodes, I expanded my skills to include data science and software development.

I have also leveraged my experiences with energy storage technologies to perform consulting work.
My areas of expertise include Li-ion, aqueous, and multivalent batteries where I am familiar with both experimental and computational approaches.
