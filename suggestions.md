# My Assorted Suggestions

Just sharing bits and pieces of things I've come across that have resonated with me or shaped my world view.

## Quotes

"Trust your body. Be kind to yourself. You are enough, just as you are right now. Your joy matters. Please tell everyone you know." - _Burnout_ by Emily and Amelia Nagoski

“We don’t lead with ‘Hi, my name is Brene and here’s my darkest struggle.’ That’s not vulnerability. That may be desperation or winded ness or even attention-seeking but it’s not vulnerability. Why? Because sharing appropriately, with boundaries, means sharing with people with whom we’ve developed relationships that can bear the weight of our story. The result of this mutually respectful vulnerability is increased connection, trust, and engagement.”  - _Daring Greatly_ by Brene Brown

"The only thing that keeps those in power in that position is the illusion of our powerlessness." - _Mutual Aid_ by Dean Spade

“I am learning to love the sound of my feet walking away from things not meant for me.” - A.G.
